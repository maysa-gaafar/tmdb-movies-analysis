# TMDb Movie Dataset Analysis 

This project explores the TMDb movie dataset using Python and Jupyter Notebook to uncover trends in genres, budgets, ratings, and revenue.

## Key Questions
- Which genres are most common?
- How does budget affect popularity and revenue?
- Which directors and production companies perform best?
- Does movie length influence rating?

## Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Conclusion

Drama, Comedy, and Action are the most common genres. Higher budgets are somewhat linked to popularity and revenue, but not always to higher ratings. Some smaller studios achieved high returns with smart budgeting. The dataset gave useful insights, though some missing values were filtered out during analysis.
